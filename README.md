<h1>File Management System using linux Terminal</h1> This project is a powerful file management system implemented in C, designed to leverage the Linux terminal environment and utilize shell scripting for performing various file management functions seamlessly. To run this program on your Linux terminal, you will need the gcc command.
<br><br>
The program offers a comprehensive menu-driven interface that allows users to interact with the file system and perform a wide range of file and directory operations efficiently. Some of the key functionalities include listing files and directories, creating new files, deleting files, renaming files, editing file content, searching files, displaying file details, viewing file content, sorting file content, working with directories, compressing and uncompressing files, executing C and shell scripts, and more.
<br><br>
By incorporating shell scripting within the C program, it harnesses the power of Linux terminal commands to achieve optimal performance and flexibility. This integration allows for seamless execution of complex file management tasks, providing a convenient and efficient solution for users.
<br><br>
To run the program, ensure that you have the gcc compiler installed on your Linux system. Open the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the source code file, and use the following command to compile the program:
<br><br>
<h3>gcc file_manager.c -o file_manager</h3>
<br>
Once the compilation is successful, you can run the program by entering the following command in the terminal:
<br>
<h3>./file_manager</h3>
